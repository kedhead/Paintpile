# PaintPile - Claude AI Configuration

## Project Context
PaintPile is a cross-platform miniature painting journal app (web, iOS, Android) built on Firebase that helps hobbyists track their painting progress, manage paint inventories, and share completed projects.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel hosting

**Brand Colors:**
- Orange: #FB923C
- Amber: #FBBF24
- Rose: #FB7185

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Define interfaces/types for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types
- Use type inference where appropriate

### React/Next.js
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Mark components with `'use client'` only when needed (server components by default)
- Use React Server Components where possible for better performance

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale
- Use brand colors from the palette above

### Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try/catch
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Include loading states for all async operations

### Component Structure
- Place components in `/components` directory
- Use descriptive names: `UserProfileCard.tsx`
- Include TypeScript interfaces for props
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## Firebase Patterns

### Authentication
- Always check auth state before data operations
- Handle auth state changes gracefully
- Provide clear feedback during auth operations

### Firestore
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states
- Cache data when appropriate
- Use Firestore security rules

### Storage
- Compress images before upload (max 1920px width)
- Generate thumbnails (400px)
- Validate file types and sizes
- Show upload progress

## File Organization

```
paintpile/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/       # React components
├── contexts/         # React contexts
├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── public/           # Static assets
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose Firebase secrets in client code
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before storage
- Use Firebase Security Rules
- Implement proper authentication checks

## Performance

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use useMemo/useCallback appropriately
- Optimize bundle size
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Testing

- Write tests for critical functionality
- Mock Firebase services in tests
- Test error cases
- Test loading states
- Test user interactions

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

## User Experience

- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Show loading states during async operations
- Display clear error messages
- Implement optimistic updates
- Maintain consistent UI patterns
